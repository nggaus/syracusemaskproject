          <h2 id="design">What designs to use?</h2>
          
          <p> There are generally two styles of fabric masks being made by hand for donation.  The simplest one is the <a href="designs_rect.html">
            <strong>rectangular mask</strong></a>.  It is easy and relatively
          fast to sew, and can optionally be made to form around the bridge of the nose with a metal nosepiece (pipe cleaner, twist tie, floral wire, or metal strip).  Rectanglar masks
          are acceptable for many healthcare centers, laboratories, and government agencies where contact with patients is minimal.<br><br>
          
          Many hospitals, however, are requesting a <a href="designs_shape.html"><strong>shaped mask</strong></a> that is more form-fitting and provide better protection for healthcare professionals that come in direct
          contact with patients.  This mask takes a little longer to make, but is very comfortable and secure.  It requires a metal nosepiece (made from household materials) to get a
          good fit across the
          bridge of the nose. <br><br>
          
          If you are not a confident sewer or you want to make a lot of masks really fast, then make the rectangular mask.  If you have a reasonable sewing ability, try
          the shaped mask since it is what the hospitals prefer.  They are going to need lots of them!<br>
