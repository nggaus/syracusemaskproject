          <h2 id="design">What designs to use:</h2>
          
          <p> There are many designs out there.  SUNY Upstate has released their <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/emergencymgt/pdf/mask_how_to_3_25rr.pdf">instruction sheet</a>
          for a close fitting, <strong>shaped</strong> mask which they prefer. I have an <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns_0405.pdf">alternate version</a> of these
          instructions (uses the same pattern pieces) that will work with a <a href="suppliers.html#nosepiece">flat aluminum nose piece</a> which is a sturdier alternative to pipe cleaners, heavy twists ties, or
          floral wire.  You may want to take a look at the alternate version even if you are using pipe cleaners, twist ties, or floral wire
          for your nose piece since this alternate assembly method might be more to your liking.  SUNY Upstate will be distributing any extra of these sewn masks to other
          hospitals in Syracuse.<br><br>
          
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> There was a question about whether the original Upstate instructions for the shaped mask included two layers of fabric or three. I confirmed this with them, and the request is for three layers -- cotton outer, flannel middle, and cotton lining.<br><br>
            
          Beth Eischen Call has these great <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">video instructions</a> for the
          <strong>rectangular</strong> masks she is making for distribution to medical labs and other healthcare facilities.
          <a href="support/rectangularMaskAssembly_0406.pdf">Written instructions</a> are now available for this style of mask.<br><br>
            
          If you are not a confident sewer or you want to make a lot of masks really fast, then go for the rectangular mask.  But if you have some reasonable sewing chops, try
          the shaped mask since it is what the hospitals prefer.  They are going to need lots of them!<br><br>
            
          <span id="longtie"><Strong>Ties:</Strong> &nbsp; Some people are reporting that the elastic ear straps are too loose on some people.  For this reason, I am starting to
          make fabric ties instead.  I am, in fact, going with one long 45" tie for the shaped mask as shown in the video below (tie goes down through one side, around the back
          of the neck, and up through the other side, then tied at the crown of the head).  The Medium-sized shaped mask may need a strap longer than 45" because it doesn't cover
          as much of the face.  You may have to experiment with this.  I want to sew as quickly as possible so I will be making all large masks with long ties which I think should
          fit most adults reasonably well.<br><br>
            
          If you have extra 1/2" bias tape on hand, this makes an excellent tie.  Just fold it lengthwise and stitch along the open edge to make a tie that is 1/4" wide.  It's narrower
          than the self-fabric ties, but still works fine.  Knot the ends to keep them from raveling. Other sewists have had success using twill tape or shoe lacing for ties.  Both
          of these would also make good choices.<br><br>
            
          If anyone knows for sure that fabric <em>ear loops</em> or <em>four corner ties</em> are preferred over <em>one long tie</em> with one knot at the crown of the head, please let me know.</span><br><br>

          <a href="https://www.weneedmasks.org/">WeNeedMasks.org</a> has information at the national level.  Their designs may be suitable for healthcare facilities other than
          SUNY Upstate, but check first before you sew.
