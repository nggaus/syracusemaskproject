        <p>
        I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and worked for General Electric in Syracuse for a number of years designing data processor boards
        for radar systems.  After a stint in graduate school, I decided to devote my time and attention to raising my family and
        volunteering as a leader for both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.<br><br>
 
        Along the way I started a home-based sewing business.  I altered bridal and formal wear, did household sewing and mending, and designed and made dance costumes for several
        local dance schools.  I recently retired my business but I love teaching people to sew and plan to offer sewing instruction in the near future.<br><Br>
 
        It wasn’t until recently that I discovered that I am actually a fifth generation seamstress.  I also have some maker genes in my family line.  My great grandfather invented
        the Gearhart Runner Knitter circular sock knitting machine for the home-based cottage industry market.  That machine made
        <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/sock-machine-helps-win-first-world-war-1.3846066">numerous socks for soldiers</a> during WWI.  My father
        was a cartographer, so maps are in my blood as well.  I’ve dabbled with a lot of different craft forms (Mom's influence) and have made a lot of pretty wacky and interesting things.  I have a
        strong affinity for the maker community and am really excited that Syracuse is planning its first Maker Faire in the spring of 2021.</p>
