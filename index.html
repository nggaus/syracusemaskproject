            <br><br>With the recent appeal by Gov. Cuomo that all New Yorkers wear masks in close public areas, many
            government services are now in need of fabric masks for their essential employees who work with the public.  We
            <em>still</em> desperately need sewists to fill those requests.  Check the <a href="https://savior-sewists.now.sh/sewists.html" class="shout-link">Drop Off Sites</a> page for a location near you!

<!-- TIMESTAMPED UPDATES -->

          
<!-- BACKSTORY -->
          <h2 id="main">Why this website?</h2>
          
          <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn masks as
          a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            
          <p> There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort
          to support hospitals in central New York.  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew
          where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            
          <p>I finally got answers.  A hospital committee at SUNY Upstate looked into the materials and design needed to make hand sewn masks as safe as possible for their
          healthcare workers to use during a shortage of CDC-approved N95 masks.  When they released the design, I created this webpage.  That design, and others,
          are posted on the <a href="designs.html" class="shout-link">DESIGNS</a> page along with sewing tips, clarifications, pictures, and videos to make it easier for local sewists
          to produce masks acceptable for healthcare professionals.
          </p>
            
<!--          <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this website and try to make it more widely available.</p> -->
            
      

          
          <p>If you are sewing for hospitals and health centers, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVnocKNgEPNSC4DRp0QV-kKfSrPmVMsczMuq1kcIUxNA8DmvG5PS5S0e8zuPRFNe0VnlGzd6segMsl/pub" class="shout-link">
            Open-Source COVID19 Situation and Supply Needs (OSCMS) group</a> emphasizes that you should be working with a group that is
          using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is
          nothing set up in your area. Find a <a href="groups.html" class="shout-link">sewing group</a> in central New York.</p>
            
<!--          <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">
          document</a> also has a list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local
          hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p> -->
          <br><br>
          
          <h2>Masks for personal use</h2>
          
            <p>
                If you are here looking for information how to make a <strong>personal mask for yourself</strong> or your family for everyday public use, you can try any of the designs
                here that are requested by hospitals and healthcare centers.  But if you want to keep it really simple, the
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/how-to-make-face-mask-coronavirus.html" class="shout-link">New York Times</a> has an easy mask that you can
                make from household items.  Another really good mask tutorial recommended by Calico Gals is

                Due to the extreme shortage of PPE in the United States, however, hospitals are requesting hand sewn masks to wear over top of standard CDC-approved
                N95 masks in order to extend the life of the approved masks.  Additionally, some healthcare faciities are running out of N95 masks and are using
                hand sewn fabric masks in liu of wearing no face protection at all.  I have listed several hospitals on my
                <a href="https://savior-sewists.now.sh/sewists.html">Drop Off Sites</a> page which are asking
                for hand sewn masks to extend or supplement their dwindling supplies.  I have made every effort to include links to the instructions these hospitals
