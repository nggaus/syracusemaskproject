                does not endorse fabric masks as a sole preventive measure to shield healthcare
                workers from the coronavirus.  Due to the extreme shortage of PPE in the United States, however, hospitals are requesting hand sewn masks to wear over top of standard
                CDC-approved N95 masks in order to extend the life of the approved masks.  Additionally, some healthcare faciities are running out of N95 masks and are using hand sewn fabric
                masks in liu of wearing no face protection at all.  I have listed several hospitals on my "Drop Off Sites" page which are asking for hand sewn masks to extend
                or supplement their
                dwindling supplies.  I have made every effort to include links to the instructions these hospitals have released for masks that they will accept.  See the "Sewing Groups"

            <p>
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 12:30 PM, 4/3/20 &nbsp; Another great tip from another sewist.  If you are running low on supplies to make ties from, twill
              tape or shoe lacing work well. See <a href="#longtie">discussion</a> below.<br><br>
              
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 6:00 PM, 4/2/20 &nbsp; SUNY Upstate has made minor updates to their document <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/emergencymgt/pdf/mask_how_to_3_25rr.pdf">"How to Make Facemasks"</a>.  If you downloaded my <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns.pdf">alternate assembly
              instructions</a> (same pattern/style) prior to today, please download it again as I have added even more tips to make assembly both
              easier and faster.
              You can access it <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns.pdf">here</a> as well as <a href="#groups">below</a>.  Note that Upstate's instructions call for
              either elastic ear loops or four corner fabric ties, and my alternate instructions give you the option of making one long fabric tie (which saves fabric and
              is very comfortable).  I don't know if the one tie is confusing -- see <a href="#video">video</a> below on how it works.  I welcome feedback on that.  Also,
              Upstate's instructions use a pipe cleaner or floral wire for a form-fitting nose piece.  My instructions call for a <a href="#nosepiece">metal strip</a>, but
              the pipe cleaner or floral
              wire will work here too.<br><br>

              <strong>Update</strong> -- 7:30 AM, 4/2/20 &nbsp; Great tip from Paige who is working on shaped masks --- instead of making a casing in the seam allowance for the nose piece,
              just zig zag stitch it down in the seam allowance when sewing the top seam. When you turn the mask right side out it's already in place. Just press and
              topstitch! Huge time saver for those with a machine that can zig-zag (which is most of them).<br><br>
              
              ALSO -- A delivery of nose pieces will be at Calico Gals by 10:00 this morning.  There will be 8-10 packages (16 strips in each package) today, and more tomorrow. Still looking
              for someone to help fabricate these. <br><br>
              
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 2:45 PM, 4/1/20 &nbsp; There was a question about whether the original Upstate instructions for the shaped mask included two layers of fabric
              or three.  I confirmed this with them, and the request is for three layers -- cotton outer, flannel middle, and cotton lining.  Also--- CALICO GALS IS OUT OF NOSE PIECES!
              I will drop off more in the morning, but am looking for someone else in the Syracuse area that is willing to make these (see instructions <a href="#nosepiece">below</a>.  I have
              lots of aluminum flashing if anyone needs raw material for this. Contact <a href="mailto:nggaus123@gmail.com">me</a> if you want some of it.<br><br>
              
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 6:00 PM, 3/31/20 &nbsp; Donna from Tully has four 2-yard pieces of 45” white flannel (on the light weight side, freshly washed) to donate.  Contact
              <a href="mailto:nggaus123@gmail.com">me</a> if you would like it.  First come, first served.<br><br>
          
              <strong>PLEASE</strong> -- <em>If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to someone who is sick, please wait until you are recovered and out of danger before
              sewing masks!</em>

          <h2 id="main">Masks needed in central New York</h2>
          
            <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn
            masks as a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            <p>There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort for central New York (maybe, but I haven’t been able to find any).  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            <p>I am finally getting answers.  As of this writing, SUNY Upstate is beginning to take donations from people who are willing and able to make masks.  There is a hospital committee that has looked
            into the materials and design needed to make them as safe as possible for their healthcare workers to use.  I have posted their information below. </p>
            <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this page and try to make it more widely available.</p>
            
      
            <p><strong>LET'S STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY OUT THERE.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS FABULOUS SEWING COMMUNITY.  USE CDC GUIDELINES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PRACTICE FREQUENT
            HANDWASHING.  WE NEED YOU HEALTHY!</strong></p>

They emphaize that you should be working with a group
            that is using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is nothing set up in your area.
            I am slowly finding groups in central New York and as I find them, I will list them below. If you know of active groups that would like assistance, please let me know and I will add
            them along with their contact information to my list.</p>
            
            <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">document</a> also has a
            list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information
            on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p>

          <h2 id="design">What designs to use:</h2>
            <p>
            There are many designs out there.  SUNY Upstate has released their <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/emergencymgt/pdf/mask_how_to_3_25rr.pdf">instruction sheet</a> for a close fitting, shaped mask which
            they prefer. I have an <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns.pdf">alternate version</a> of these instructions (uses the same pattern pieces) that will work with a
            flat aluminum nose piece.  You may want to take a look at the updated version even if you are using pipe cleaners, heavy twist ties, or floral wire for your nose piece
            since this alternate assembly method might be more to your liking.  SUNY Upstate will be distributing any extra of these sewn masks to other hospitals in Syracuse.<br><br>
            
            Beth Eischen Call has these great <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">instructions</a> for the rectangular masks
            she is making for distribution to medical labs and other healthcare facilities.  If you want to add a wire or metal strip to a rectangular mask to make a better fit, see
            this <a href="support/NosePieceOptions.pdf">information sheet</a> with tips on adding a casing to the top edge of your masks.<br><br>
            
            If you are not a confident sewer or you want to make a bunch really fast, then go for the rectangular mask.  But if you have some reasonable sewing chops, try
            the shaped mask since it is what the hospitals prefer.  They are going to need lots of them!<br><br>
            
            <span id="longtie"><Strong>Ties:</Strong> &nbsp;
            Some people are reporting that the elastic ear straps are too loose on some people.  For this reason, I am starting to make fabric ties instead.  I am,
            in fact, going with one long 45" tie for the shaped mask as shown in the video below (tie goes down through one side, around the back of the neck, and up through the other side,
            then tied at the crown of the head).  The Medium-sized shaped mask may need a strap longer than 45" because
            it doesn't cover as much of the face.  You may have to experiment with this.  I want to sew as quickly as possible so I will be making all large masks with long
            ties which I think should fit most adults reasonably well.<br><br>
            
            If you have extra 1/2" bias tape on hand, this makes an excellent tie.  Just fold it lengthwise and stitch along the open edge to make a tie that is 1/4" wide.  It's narrower
            than the self-fabric ties, but still works fine.  Knot the ends to keep them from raveling. Other sewists have had success using twill tape or shoe lacing for ties.
            Both of these would also make good choices.<br><br>
            
            If anyone knows for sure that fabric <em>ear loops</em> or <em>four corner ties</em> are preferred over <em>tying behind the head</em>, please let me know.</span><br><br>

            <li id="nosepiece"><strong>Nose pieces:</strong>  There are a number of things you can use for the nose pieces on the shaped masks.  Some people are using pipe cleaners or

            metal snips</a> or heavy scissors. Nip off the corners so they are more "user friendly" and slide into the casing easier.  The more accurate you make the ¼” cut
            the better -- these need to slide into a narrow casing and if they are too wide, they won’t fit!&nbsp;  If the edges seem sharp, you can sand them lightly, but
            I’ve found this to be unnecessary.  Please wash your hands thoroughly and disinfect sheets of flashing before cutting strips.  <br><br>

<!-- FAQ -->

          <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
          <ul class="plain-list">
            <li><strong>How do I know I have the right materials in my stash?</strong><br>
            Current instructions are calling for tightly woven, <em>prewashed</em> cotton (quilting cotton will do), <em>prewashed</em> flannel if you have it (for filling), either
            narrow flat elastic or elastic cord OR self fabric ties (ties are probably better because they are adjustable), and, if you are making shaped masks, you will need a nose
            piece (see below).</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>I don’t have the materials at home.  Where can I get them?</strong><br>
              You can purchase locally from stores listed below or order online. JoAnn Fabrics is now offering curb-side service if you order ahead. </li><br>
              
            <li><strong>I know how to sew but I don’t have a machine.  Where can I get one?</strong><br>
              Ask friends and neighbors if they have any old machines in their closets.  As long as it can sew a solid straight stitch, you’re good.  If you can’t get your
              hands on one, then pair up with someone who does have one and offer to cut out fabric pieces or make a run to the fabric store for supplies (for front porch drop offs).
              JoAnn Fabrics is now offering curb-side service if you order ahead.<br><br>
              If you are really at a loss, you can sew the masks by hand.  Make sure they are sturdy enough to stand up to repeated washing though.  You could also cut metal strip
              <strong>nose pieces</strong> for people that are making the shaped masks.  See instructions <a href="#nosepiece">above</a>.</li><br>
              
            <li><strong>Where do I take them when I have a bunch made?</strong><br>

            </li><br>
              
            <li><strong>But fabric masks are not sterile.  Can they really be used?</strong><br>
              At this point, due to extreme shortages, the CDC is loosening it's guidelines and allowing healthcare centers to use fabric masks. &nbsp; It's better than going without.
              &nbsp; In some
              situations, the fabric masks can be used over top of the approved sterile masks to extend their lifespan.  &nbsp; In other situations, the fabric masks will be the only thing
              available.  They can be washed and reused.  &nbsp; Be sure to <em>prewash</em> your fabrics before making the masks, thoroughly wash your hands before working on them, clean your sewing area, and pack completed
              masks in plastic bags or boxes with lids for delivery.  &nbsp; Healthcare centers will be washing them before use.  &nbsp; <em>If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to someone
              who is sick, please wait until you are recovered and out of danger before sewing masks!!</em>
            </li><br>
            
            <li><strong>I sew slowly.  How can I make masks faster?</strong><br>
              Making one mask at a time is not very productive.  In quilting there is a technique called “chain piecing” in which the same seam on a number of blocks are sewn one right after
              the other without lifting the presser foot or snipping the threads between each one.  Once you have your mask pieces cut out, you can stack them up in order and sew them together
              in stages using the chain piecing technique.  There are any number of YouTube videos showing how this works.<br><br>
              
              You can produce masks even faster if you team up with someone who is good at cutting (either at home or via front porch delivery).  They can cut the fabric pieces and stack them
              for you, freeing you up to just sew. Make sure you choose someone that can cut relatively precisely, though.  The more precise the pieces are cut, the easier the masks will sew together.
              Using a rotary cutter and a cutting mat will significantly increase both your speed and precision in cutting out the pieces.<br><br>
              
              Consider making all one size at once.  If you are trying to make a combination of Large- and Medium-sized masks, for example, it is easy to get the pieces confused and that will slow
              you down.  Sew all Large masks one day and all Medium masks the next day.  Or just sew all one size and eliminate the problem all together.
