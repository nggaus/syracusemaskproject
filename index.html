            <p>
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 11:00 AM, 4/7/20 &nbsp;<br>
              Calico Gals has added a new program called the
              <strong>Family Mask Project</strong>. Calico Gals is donating mask fabric kits to anyone making masks for family, friends and neighbors.
              Here's how the program works:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Each kit makes 4 masks. Request mask kits by emailing <a href="mailto:marcia@calicogals.com">marcia@calicogals.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Due to the shortage of elastic, they recommend t-shirt fabric for ties. These are easy to make and comfortable to wear. Even
                kids can help. Click <a href="https://www.madeeveryday.com/fabric-face-mask-free-pattern/">here</a> for an excellent pattern and video for making ties and masks.</li>
                <li>Please do not request mask kits if you are making masks to sell to others. We appreciate and respect your work, but this project
                is specifically for families in need.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 11:00 AM, 4/6/20 &nbsp; I now have <a href="support/rectangularMaskAssembly_0406.pdf">written instructions</a> to go along with
              Beth's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">video tutorial</a> for the rectangular mask.  These
              instructions help clarify the assembly process.  If you have been having trouble making the
              shaped masks, try this design out.  It is faster and easier to make, and some heathcare centers and agencies will gladly accept them.<br><br>

              <strong>Update</strong> -- 8:00 PM, 4/4/20 &nbsp; This project can now be found at <a href="https://syracusemaskproject.org">syracusemaskproject.org</a> as
              well as <a href="https://www.nancysews.com">www.nancysews.com</a>.  Added a new page for listings of donated supplies and supplies needed (HAVE/NEED button
              above).<br><br>

              <strong>Update</strong> -- 12:30 PM, 4/3/20 &nbsp; Another great tip from another sewist.  If you are running low on supplies to make ties from, twill
              tape or shoe lacing work well. See <a href="#longtie">discussion</a> below.<br><br>
              
              <strong>Update</strong> -- 6:00 PM, 4/2/20 &nbsp; SUNY Upstate has made minor updates to their document
              <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/emergencymgt/pdf/mask_how_to_3_25rr.pdf">"How to Make Facemasks"</a>.  If you downloaded my
              <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns_0405.pdf">alternate assembly instructions</a> (same pattern/style) prior to today, please download it again as I
              have added even more tips to make assembly both easier and faster.  Note that Upstate's instructions call for either elastic ear loops or four corner fabric ties, and my alternate instructions
              give you the option of making one long fabric tie (which saves fabric and is very comfortable).  I don't know if the one tie is confusing -- see
              <a href="#video">video</a> below on how it works.  I welcome feedback on that.  Also, Upstate's instructions use a pipe cleaner or floral wire for a
              form-fitting nose piece.  My instructions call for a <a href="#nosepiece">metal strip</a>, but the pipe cleaner or floral wire will work here too.<br><br>
          
              <strong>PLEASE</strong> -- <em>If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to someone who is sick, please wait until you are recovered and out of danger before
              sewing masks!</em>

<!-- BACKSTORY -->
          <h2 id="main">Masks needed in central New York</h2>
          
          <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn masks as
          a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            
          <p>There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort
          for central New York (maybe, but haven’t been able to find any).  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew
          where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            
          <p>I finally got answers.  SUNY Upstate and other hospitals, laboratories, healthcare centers, and agencies are taking donations from people who are willing
          and able to sew masks.  A
          hospital committee at SUNY Upstate looked into the materials and design needed to make them as safe as possible for their healthcare workers to use.  That design,
          and others,
          is posted on the <a href="designs.html">DESIGNS</a> page. </p>
            
          <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this page and try to make it more widely available.</p>
            
      
          <p><strong>LET'S STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY OUT THERE.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS FABULOUS SEWING COMMUNITY.  USE CDC GUIDELINES
          FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PRACTICE FREQUENT HANDWASHING.  WE NEED YOU HEALTHY!</strong></p>

          some basic information from the Open-Source COVID19 Situation and Supply Needs (OSCMS) group.  They emphaize that you should be working with a group that is
          using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is
          nothing set up in your area. I am slowly finding groups in central New York and as I find them, I will list them below. If you know of active groups that would
          like assistance, please let me know and I will add them along with their contact information to my list.</p>
            
          <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">
          document</a> also has a list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local
          hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p>

                Due to the extreme shortage of PPE in the United States, however, hospitals are requesting hand sewn masks to wear over top of standard CDC-approved
                N95 masks in order to extend the life of the approved masks.  Additionally, some healthcare faciities are running out of N95 masks and are using
                hand sewn fabric masks in liu of wearing no face protection at all.  I have listed several hospitals on my "Drop Off Sites" page which are asking
                for hand sewn masks to extend or supplement their dwindling supplies.  I have made every effort to include links to the instructions these hospitals
                have released for masks that they will accept.  See the "Sewing Groups" section below for more information on locally requested mask styles.<br><br>
