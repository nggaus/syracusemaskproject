<!-- TIMESTAMPED UPDATES -->

          
<!-- BACKSTORY -->
          <h2 id="main">Why this website?</h2>
          
          <p>When I first got this website online at the beginning of April, the pandemic was in full swing in New York state and the shortage of personal protective equipment was dire.  Hospitals and health centers were scrambling for supplies and any surplus was being sent to the front lines in New York city.  My focus was to provide reliable information for people sewing fabric masks for local donation so that they could create and donate the type of masks that were most effective for healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>Along the way I received tips from people that were discovering new and better ways to assemble the masks.  I received clarifications from the healthcare community about the patterns and materials that were most effective.  As the month progressed I began getting donation requests on this site for front line workers at grocery stores, police departments, government agencies, and assisted living facilities.  The order for all New York state residents to wear face masks in public areas took some by surprise and there was increased traffic to the site by people looking for information about making personal masks. I’ve done my best to keep the site relevant and useful.</p>

          <p>Here it is May, and it’s hard to believe that masks are still in short supply.  I figured that my site would have run its course by now, but it seems that reliable mask information is still in demand.  This site will remain in place as long as it’s needed and for whomever needs the information.  I continue to add tips for those making masks, and especially for those who are still willing to make masks for donation.  I continue to accept useful information sent in by helpful sewists.  </p>

          <p>There is still a demand and every new mask is finding a grateful home.  Stay healthy, follow the rules, and keep sewing!</p>

          <p>-Nancy</p>

          <p>As you have likely heard, there is a national shortage of surgical masks.  Hospitals are in desperate need.  They are beginning to take hand sewn masks as
          a stop gap until the shortages are alleviated.  </p>
            
          <p> There are plenty of patterns and advice online, and a lot of people jumping in to make masks, but it wasn’t clear to me that there was any organized effort
          to support hospitals in central New York.  I wasn’t willing to proceed until I knew that 1) what I was making was acceptable; 2) I knew
          where they were needed locally; and 3) I knew how to deliver them without creating more confusion at busy hospitals and medical facilities.</p>
            
          <p>I finally got answers.  A hospital committee at SUNY Upstate looked into the materials and design needed to make hand sewn masks as safe as possible for their
          healthcare workers to use during a shortage of CDC-approved N95 masks.  When they released the design, I created this webpage.  That design, and others,
          are posted on the <a href="designs.html" class="shout-link">DESIGNS</a> page along with sewing tips, clarifications, pictures, and videos to make it easier for local sewists
          to produce masks acceptable for healthcare professionals.
          </p>
            
          <p>LET'S CROWD SOURCE THIS!  &nbsp; If you have good information to add, let me know. I will update this website and try to make it more widely available.</p>
            
      

          
          <p>If you are sewing for hospitals and health centers, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQVnocKNgEPNSC4DRp0QV-kKfSrPmVMsczMuq1kcIUxNA8DmvG5PS5S0e8zuPRFNe0VnlGzd6segMsl/pub" class="shout-link">
            Open-Source COVID19 Situation and Supply Needs (OSCMS) group</a> emphasizes that you should be working with a group that is
          using a vetted design and has a distribution network setup so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.  Don't reinvent the wheel and go it alone unless there is
          nothing set up in your area. Find a <a href="groups.html" class="shout-link">sewing group</a> in central New York.</p>
            
<!--          <p>OSCMS provides a link to a document that enumerates a number of features and materials that are better for masks.  This <a href="support/OSCMSmaskinfo_032520.pdf">
          document</a> also has a list of patterns for masks that are more likely to be approved by local hospitals.  But again, you should be trying to make what the local
          hospitals and health centers actually need.  If you have information on which center requires what, I can also add that to my list.</p> -->

          <h2>Masks for personal use</h2>
          
            <p>
                If you are here looking for information how to make a <strong>personal mask for yourself</strong> or your family for everyday public use, you can try any of the designs
                here that are requested by hospitals and healthcare centers.  But if you want to keep it really simple, the

                Due to the extreme shortage of PPE in the United States, however, hospitals are requesting hand sewn masks to wear over top of standard CDC-approved
                N95 masks in order to extend the life of the approved masks.  Additionally, some healthcare faciities are running out of N95 masks and are using
