            Beth is accepting help with fabric cutting, sewing, pickup, and delivery of both supplies and finished masks.  See her
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/719432441/videos/pcb.10158138768207442/10158138766572442/">video tutorial</a> for making rectangular masks.   I now have written
            <a href="support/rectangularMaskAssembly_0408.pdf">written instructions</a> to go along with Beth's tutorial which help clarify the assembly process.</li><br>

            I will be following the instructions and patterns for shaped masks as outlined in SUNY Upstate's <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/emergencymgt/pdf/mask_how_to_3_25rr.pdf">
            How to Make Facemasks</a>.  I have an <a href="support/UpdatedAssemblyWithPatterns_0405.pdf">alternate version</a> of these instructions available with a different order of
            operations that might be easier for some to follow.  I am using a flat metal strip for the form-fitting <a href="suppliers.html#nosepiece">nose piece</a>. I will be making a
            limited supply of nose pieces for local seamstresses in Baldwinsville, although you can use a number of items for the nose piece needed
            for this mask. There will be a drop off bin on my front porch for finished masks.  Please leave your name and contact information with your
            donation and I'll make sure they get to Upstate.</li><br>

            metal strip <a href="suppliers.html#nosepiece">nose pieces</a> that are a popular option to place in form-fitting masks (check inside the outdoor drop off bin for these).
            They are a source for fabric and are now
            offering <a href="index.html#family">Family Mask Project</a> kits.  Call (315-445-0617) or <a href="mailto:store@calicogals.com">email</a> them to arrange pickup of

            They would prefer it cut. Each mask requires a 7 1/2" x 15" cut piece plus a 2" x 6" strip. You can make packs of 10, including ten 7 1/2" x 15" pieces and one 2" x 60"
            strip. They can be dropped off at the store in Fairport. The store also has a link on its website on how to make these masks.  </li><br>
